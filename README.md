# FINANCIAL-AID-SYSTEM
DUT PROJECT 
In today's educational landscape, access to financial aid through bursaries plays a pivotal role in empowering students to pursue their academic ambitions. However, the traditional application processes for bursaries can often be time-consuming for both applicants and administrators alike. Recognizing the need for a streamlined and efficient solution, we have developed a comprehensive Financial Aid System that revolutionizes the way students apply for financial assistance while providing administrators with powerful tools to manage applications effectively.
